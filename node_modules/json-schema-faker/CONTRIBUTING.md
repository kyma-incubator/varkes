Contribution to the project is more than welcome!

## Issues & Pull-requests

* When submitting *bugs* (or inappropriate behavior), do *paste your schema example* if only it's possible. This will prevent us from explicitly asking you to do this.
* When submitting *PRs*, ship them under the `develop` branch.
* The testing approach architecture is described in [spec/README.md](spec/README.md).
* For commits, in order to pass the tests, the developer will need a coveralls.io account synced with github. Lack of it will result in 422 Error (see [this failed travis job](https://travis-ci.org/ducin/json-schema-faker/builds/62396254))
* PR without specs will not be merged soon.

## Releasing new versions

* Include a new entry in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file,
* Be followed by rebuilding and re-releasing new online demo, see [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/json-schema-faker/json-schema-faker/tree/gh-pages).
