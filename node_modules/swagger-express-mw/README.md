# Middleware for Open API (Swagger) projects

This middleware is used by the [Swagger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger) project. It is designed to handle all your Open API-driven project needs with minimal fuss - and maximal flexibility.

### Important!
This is primarily a wrapper for the [swagger-node-runner](https://github.com/theganyo/swagger-node-runner) project. Be sure to follow that project and read the release notes there!
